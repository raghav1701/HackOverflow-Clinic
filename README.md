Industrial Revolution 4.0 has put us in a critical spot to gather and manipulate huge amounts of data and automation is an integral part of the 21st century now. Almost every sector of the present world is directly or indirectly dependent on machines or in broad sense Artificial Intelligence and the medical field is no more an exception. With the increasing pressure and rush it becomes really important to automate health services and at certain instances it has been observed that AI has taken over humans. 

With an attempt to add to it, our team ‘BUG BUSTERS’ have prepared a ‘HEALTHSY’ application that provides a facility to test and predict the health risk of the patient based on his/her reports for which we have trained the models on unbiased and distributed datasets. 
Presently our application works for following :

**Eye:** Customers can have an online vision test and can also check color blindness,contrast and     astigmatism.

**Ear:** By answering a few questions, customers can make appropriate decisions on what level of care is needed(if any). 

**Heart:** Questions are set accordingly to give proper guidance to customers whether they are having serious symptoms or not.

**Liver:** Having any symptoms and want to confirm if it needs a check-up, confirm here online.

**Diabetes:** Do you think you are fine, have check-up online and know if you have any symptoms of diabetes or not.

Our application can predict the disease within no time without compromising with the accuracy.
The models are trained in such a way that the predictions do not get biased. All the important features are taken in care for making predictions. This application can work on a wide range of diseases including liver, heart, diabetes, eye and ears.

## WHY ‘HEALTHSY’ ?

**1. Lack of Doctors:** India is facing a huge shortage of Doctors. According to the report presented by WHO, there are 0.79 doctors  and 2.09 nurses per present per 1000 people. Thus, our application provides a platform for quick and accurate prediction of disease.

**2. Low Accessibility:** The physical access to hospitals is still the major barrier to both preventive and curative health services,and also the major differences between the Rural and the Urban India. By making use of web technology and  AI people in remote areas can also get access to the health-care

**3. Affordable:** It is the biggest problem many Poor and marginalised are hit the most as by the government estimates, approx. 63 million  people are faced with poverty every year because of their healthcare expenditure. Using the technology in a better way healthcare can be made affordable for everyone.

**4. Frauds:** Several cases are reported in recent times where many frauds have taken place in the name of prediction of disease. This tool can serve  as a primary tool for confirmation.
